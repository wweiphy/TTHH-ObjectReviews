# TTHH-ObjectReviews

Standalone scripts for object reviews

- BTV
  
  - GetBtagCorrection.py: calculate correction factor for btagging shape SFs for each sample
  - PlotBTVWeightPerJet.py: plot btagging SFs in nominal, up & down and compare event yield before applying SF, after SF and after SF + correction

- EGM
  
  - EleID-Veto-Efficiency.py: calculate electron ID and sub-leading electron veto efficiency
  - EleTrigger-Compare.py: compare single electron SFs in 5j4b and 4j3b regions

- HCOMB
  
  - PlotSystsVariations.ipynv: plot up/down vs nominal comparison for final discriminators
    - systList-2018.csv: specify systematics to plot

  - PlotWeightISRFSR.py: plot ISR, FSR up/down vs nominal weight for each output nodes
  - PrePostFitPlots.py: plot Higgs Combine pre-fit and post-fit plot for final discriminators
  - UpperLimitCombine.ipynb: plot CMS standard upper limit results combined in three years
  - datacards reviews in gitlab: https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-analysis/hig/HIG-24-016/datacards
